\section{What is HOOVER?}

HOOVER is a distributed framework for solving streaming/dynamic graph problems
where the structure of a graph changes over time based on the state of its
vertices. HOOVER emphasizes flexibility without sacrificing scalability,
allowing users to plug in nearly-arbitrary callbacks for application-specific
logic while:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using OpenSHMEM as a scalable backend for inter-PE communication.
\item Using communication-avoiding techniques to reduce inter-PE communication.
\item Being PGAS-by-design from the beginning, leveraging one-sided
communication and de-coupled execution to reduce blocking and increase
asynchrony.
\end{enumerate}

The following sections serve as both a design document as well as a user guide,
describing the high level software architecture of HOOVER as well as how one
uses it.

Any questions on HOOVER can be posted on the HOOVER Github
